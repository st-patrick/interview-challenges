# Here's the idea: for every letter in the shorter or equal string, we find
# the same letter in the other string with minimal distance. If there is
# none, it's obviously a replacement candidate
# Finally, we prioritize shorter distances over long distances if any "cross"

def distance(s1, s2):
  
         
print distance('biting', 'sitting')
